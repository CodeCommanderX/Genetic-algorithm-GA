Introduction
In the history of science and technology, the emergence of electronic computers is considered one of the greatest revolutions. It has profoundly changed many important fields in a short period, rather than over decades as in previous centuries. These achievements are largely due to the form of computer programs that have created today's artificial intelligence and artificial life.

Initially, it was applied to calculate rocket trajectories and decode messages in the military field. Then, in the 1980s, it was developed and widely applied in neural networks, machine learning, and the field known as "evolutionary computation," where genetic algorithms are prominent examples.

Brief History of Evolutionary Computation
In the 1950s and 1960s, some computer scientists, during their studies of evolutionary systems, proposed ideas in which the common theme was to develop a number of candidate solutions to a problem by using operators inspired by natural genetic variation and selection from Darwin's theory of biological evolution.

In 1965, Rechenberg introduced the book "Evolution Strategies," proposing a method he used to optimize real-valued parameters for devices such as Airfoils. This idea was further developed by Schwefel. Genetic algorithms were invented by John Holland in the 1960s and further developed by his students and colleagues at the University of Michigan in the 1960s and 1970s. Holland's algorithms were initially designed not to solve specific problems but to formally study the phenomena of adaptation as it occurs in nature and develop ways in which natural adaptive mechanisms could be brought into computer systems.

Methodologies for Search and Optimization
Currently, optimization algorithms are classified into two main groups: Traditional methods and non-traditional methods.

Traditional Methods:
These methods search for optimal solutions to continuous and characteristic sign functions. They analyze and use separate computational techniques to search for optimal points of problems. There are two types: direct methods and gradient-based methods.

Direct methods: These methods do not incorporate any derivative information into the objective function; only its value guides the search process. Direct search methods are often slow, requiring many function evaluations for convergence. Algorithms representative of this method include Bracketing methods, Region-elimination method, Point estimation method.

Gradient methods: Use derivatives from objective functions to guide the search process.

However, most traditional methods have limitations such as convergence to an optimal solution depending on the initial solutions chosen, tendencies to get "stuck" in a local optimum, effectiveness in solving one optimization problem but may not be effective in solving another, inefficiency in handling discrete variable problems, and inability to be efficiently utilized on parallel computers.

Non-Traditional Methods:
These methods are relatively new and becoming increasingly popular. Two such algorithms are:

Genetic Algorithm (GA)
Simulated Annealing
The difference between genetic algorithms and traditional optimization algorithms:

GAs work with an encoding of solution parameters rather than the parameters themselves.
GAs search from a population of points rather than a single point.
GAs use probabilistic transition rules, not deterministic rules.
Genetic Algorithm
Genetic algorithm (GA) is an iterative algorithm using a random process to explore and optimize solutions, inspired by Darwin's theory of biological evolution.

Each organism consists of one or more cells, such as humans, comprising about 10^14 cells. Each cell contains the same set of one or more DNA chromosome sequences, serving as a "design blueprint" for organisms. A chromosome can be divided into Genetics and encoded into characteristic proteins. Each different trait is set up (e.g., blue, brown, light brown) called an allele. Each Genetic is located at a specific position on the chromosome. Many organisms have multiple chromosomes per cell. The complete collection of genetic materials (all chromosomes taken together) is called the Genetic system of the organism. Two individuals with identical gene sets are considered to have the same gene type. Organisms with chromosome pairs are called diploid; organisms with single chromosomes are called haploid.

In genetic algorithms, a chromosome often refers to a candidate solution and is usually encoded as a bit string. "Genetic" is one of two unique bits or short blocks of bits encoding a specific aspect of a candidate solution. In the process of natural selection, which types of adaptations are fit will survive, and conversely, unfit types will be eliminated. Genetic inheritance of an organism is achieved through the process of mating (Crossover), mutation (Mutation), and reproduction (Reproduction) over generations, natural selection with the process of eliminating unfit types. With a large genetic combination, a species will gradually evolve (gradually optimize) through natural selection, even though the number of individuals in the species is not large enough for a complete set of genetic combinations. This crossing, inheritance process will create a new generation with adapted characteristics, and the mutation process creates new genetic combinations that may have higher adaptability.

Advantages and Disadvantages
Convergence to Local Optima: Genetic algorithms may converge to local optima if the fitness function is not properly chosen, but they cannot guarantee global optimality.

Population Size: The initial population size is crucial. A large initial population may consume excessive system resources, while a small one may overlook optimal solutions.

Encoding Solutions: Each solution is typically encoded based on real-world conditions, facilitating the definition of variation and fitness functions.

Encoding Length and Mutation Rate: The length of the encoded solution and the mutation rate significantly impact algorithm effectiveness. Proper mutation length is key to enhancing diversity.

Dynamic Data: Genetic algorithms face challenges in dynamic data scenarios, where premature convergence may occur. Strategies like hypermutation are proposed to maintain diversity.

Selection vs. Crossover and Mutation: The importance of crossover and mutation in comparison to selection is debated. While mutation preserves feasible solutions, crossover fosters population diversity.

Speed and Complexity: Genetic algorithms quickly find good solutions even in complex solution spaces. However, they might not always be the optimal optimization strategy and should be analyzed case by case.

Exploration of Solution Space: Genetic algorithms struggle with "needle in a haystack" problems due to inaccurate fitness functions, leading to directional ambiguity.

Parameter Tuning: Adjusting algorithm parameters such as population size, crossover rate, mutation rate, and fitness function can improve convergence. There are no strict upper or lower bounds for these parameters.

Conclusion
Genetic algorithms offer a versatile approach to optimization problems but require careful consideration of their strengths and limitations. They excel in exploring solution spaces but may not always guarantee the optimal solution. Parameter tuning and problem-specific analysis are essential for maximizing their effectiveness.
